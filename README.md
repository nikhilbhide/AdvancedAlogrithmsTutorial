# AdvancedAlogrithmsTutorial
This repository includes implementation of different advaned algorithms in Java/Scala.
As of now, following algorithms are implemented
1. CircularQueue of any size - This algorithm detects the cycle in the connected components. Its the circular queue nested in a queue.
2. Graph Breadth First Traversal - Breadth first traversal algorithm using Queue.
3. Graph Depth First Traversal - Depth first traversal algorithm using Stack.
4. Detect cycle in the graph - This algorithm detects cycle in the graph using DFS
5. Maze Runner - This is the implementation of Maze Runner problem. This is the implementation of Maze Runner problem. A Maze is given as N*N binary matrix of blocks where source block is represented by number 2 and destination block by number 3. 0 means close door and 1 means open door.
6. Dijkstra's algorithm - Shortest path in graph algorithm 
7. Bellman Ford algorithm - Dijkstra's algorithm can not handle negative edge weights. In this case, Bellman Ford algorithm comes handy.
A graph having negative weights is used in stock market, forex arbitrage, chemical reaction.
8. Longest Path Traversal - Bellman Ford algorithm is used to find longest path in the graph. One change is required that is to negate the weights.

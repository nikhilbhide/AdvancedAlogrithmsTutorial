# AdvancedAlogrithmsTutorial
This repository includes implementation of different advaned algorithms in Java/Scala.
As of now, following algorithms are implemented
1. CircularQueue of any size - This algorithm detects the cycle in the connected components. Its the circular queue nested in a queue.
2. Graph Breadth First Traversal - Breadth first traversal algorithm using Queue.
3. Graph Depth First Traversal - Depth first traversal algorithm using Stack.
4. Detect cycle in the graph - This algorithm detects cycle in the graph using DFS
